They do this really well and it’s a really valuable erosion solution valued at nearly $1 billion per year (Yao et al. 2021)."

            "text": "Forests on steep, erosion-prone land significantly reduce landslides and erosion compared to bare pasture due to their thick roots and leafy canopies. The tree roots reinforce the soil and the umbrella effect of the tree canopy slows rainfall, keeps soils drier and stronger which in turn helps prevent slipping and erosion."

During this period, the risk of erosion is much greater and landslides can move woody debris downslope."

            "text": "[Debris flows](https://www.docs.forestrycatchmentplanner.nz/erosion-susceptibility#debris-flows) occur when heavy rainfall causes landslides to deliver large quantities of sediment to stream channels in a short period of time. The combination of landslides and debris flows represent significant contributors of erosion and sediment downstream. This has impacts on our environment, our economy, our infrastructure and our communities."
