## Erosion in New Zealand Landscapes

Forests on steep, erosion-prone land significantly reduce landslides and erosion compared to pastures due to their thick  roots and leafy canopies. This root reinforcement effect and umbrella effect keep the soil dry and strong, preventing slips and erosion.

However, plantation forests in New Zealand are clear-felled at maturity, typically around 28 years, creating a window of vulnerability for about six years until the new crop establishes itself. During this period, the risk of erosion increases, and landslides can move woody debris downslope.
