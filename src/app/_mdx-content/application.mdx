## Transparent and Sustainable Forestry Planning

The Forestry Catchment Planner aims to create a transparent,
cohesive system for better understanding intergenerational
harvesting cycles on a catchment scale.

The tool provides insights into forestry stand locations, recent
harvests, and data on erosion susceptibility hazard for future
harvesting schedules.

This enables effective environmental stewardship, improving
water quality, promoting healthier ecosystems, and facilitating
better holistic planning for future planting and harvesting.
