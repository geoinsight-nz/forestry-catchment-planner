# Key questions

- Where are the exotic forests located across Te Tauihu, Te Matau-a-Māui, and Tairāwhiti, and how can we classify them by age to identify maturing forests?
- How can we visualize regions and catchments where significant clearfell harvesting is anticipated, and assess the associated risks for potential mass erosion?
- Can we identify areas approaching harvest and classify the underlying land's vulnerability to landslides, as well as predict the probability of debris flows in the context of large storm events?
- How do we understand and manage the intergenerational risks arising from the overlap of forestry harvesting cycles and extreme weather events?
- What measures can empower tangata whenua to protect cultural heritage while promoting holistic land use thinking and proactive catchment planning?
